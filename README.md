# Dissipative Quantum Hydrodynamics

A thermodynamic framework unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity through dissipative dynamics.

### 1. **Unification: The Missing Arrow of Time** (Start here!)
A pedagogical introduction using only classical mechanics to explain why QM-GR unification must be dissipative.

**Key argument:** Real systems have constraints → dissipation is unavoidable → QM and GR are both "free" theories → their unification must incorporate the arrow of time. 📄 [Download PDF](arrow-of-time.pdf)

### 2. **Dissipative Quantum Hydrodynamics** (Full technical framework)
The complete relativistic framework implementing dissipative unification via modified Einstein-Hilbert action.

**Paper:** [View on figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.30615254)

### 3. **Emergence of Planck Scales** 
Shows that Planck scales and fundamental constants emerge from the EHK action itself
